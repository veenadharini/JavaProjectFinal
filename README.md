Application Name: Seat Reservation & Food Booking


Proposal of the application: A sophisticated seat reservation system for the university that displays seat availability and enables students/faculty to reserve seats based on the available time slots and time constraints. Along with this, our system also incorporates a food ordering system where students can make their orders through their favorite available restaurants in the university using our application. This includes QR scanner module, order status tracking, payment modules, to function coherently with the seat reservation system.
Real time check-in through QR scanning with system to penalize students who misuse the system. QR confirmation check-in for food orders to increase security in the process.
